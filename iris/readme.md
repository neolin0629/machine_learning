This is the learning project of [tensorflow premade estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/premade_estimators). There are two APIs for using tensorflow:
   - [Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimators), which represent a complete model. The Estimator API provides methods to train the model, to judge the model's accuracy, and to generate predictions.
   - [Datasets for Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets_for_estimators), which build a data input pipeline. The Dataset API has methods to load and manipulate data, and feed it into your model. The Dataset API meshes well with the Estimators API.
